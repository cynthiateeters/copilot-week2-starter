## Context modification

This section documents how you modified the `copilot-instructions.md` file and what happened.

### What I changed

[Describe the instruction you added or modified in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`]

### How it affected Copilot

[Describe how Copilot's behavior changed after your modification. Did it follow your new instruction? Give a specific example.]

---

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### AI as a communication tool (required)

[After reading ai-as-communication-tool.md, how did thinking about AI as a "translator" change how you approached this assignment? Give an example of a communication task AI helped you with.]

### Agent mode for setup (required)

[How was using Agent for npm setup different from typing commands yourself? What are the advantages? Any downsides?]

**Example answer:** "Using Agent for npm setup was faster than typing commands myself because I didn't have to look up the exact syntax. The downside was I didn't fully understand what each command did until I used /explain."

### Creating documentation with Agent (required)

[How did it feel to create docs with Agent's help? Did you edit what Agent produced, or use it as-is? Why?]

### Context awareness (required)

[How did modifying `copilot-instructions.md` change your understanding of how AI assistants work? Why might this be useful?]

### Commit messages (optional)

[Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages? If so, how did they compare to messages you would have written yourself?]

### Using /explain (optional)

[Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful? What did you learn?]

### Understanding npm (optional)

[What npm concepts did you understand better after this assignment? What would you still like to learn more about?]

## Optional

**Approximate time spent working with AI:** [e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour]

**Favorite cowsay creature:** [Which one and why?]
